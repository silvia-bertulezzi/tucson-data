Very Negative,4,0.27,867,"i'd give it a 5 for just the tortilla soup which is what i come for, but since i'm rating on the entire restaurant, i can't do it. i love the tortilla soup.  i get it by the bowl (i'd buy it by the gallon if i could) with sour cream and avocado and inhale it.  i don't normally get anything else to eat here.  although, i have had the melted cheese and tortilla appetizer too which is very good. but, i don't know what it is about micheladas here.  i don't like having to make my own.  and it's served in 3 glasses here.  i'll drop them a whole star for that.  i know, rough, but it's a single drink and should be served in a single glass. now, i love their tortillas here.  if you can watch the cooks, there are a couple who are continually making tortillas.  a ball of maza into the tortilla press then on to comal, flip, and into the basket.  a round of yummy!!"
Very Negative,4,0.269,597,"this is a relic, a place that time forgot. a dinosaur, with a dangerous parking situation in a sketchy neighborhood and you had better bring cash. if it was on a busier street in a faster-paced neighborhood, it would have been eaten by the chains.  perhaps. but they have the old-school flavored flattop fried burgers of my earliest memories, fantastic nasty-ass chili dogs with a great following, and the bestest fries you can find outside of the benelux border countries. the fries are worth the trip alone.   and for $8.40 you get a shoebox full of them and four burgers.  suck it, five guys."
Very Negative,5,0.269,606,"they get five stars from me simply for having the most amazing volcano tuna don. what can i say about it that hasn't already been said before? nothing really, you just have to try it for yourself. it's so darned good i will drive 45 minutes from where i live in the middle of nowhere just to get my fix. i've had several other menu items, but i can't say i like them as much. specifically, the seafood dynamite was my least favorite because it just tasted like a mouthful of mayo, and the shoyu ramen was very bland. but no worries, i don't need anything else from their menu. volcano tuna don i heart you."
Very Negative,5,0.268,102,"by far the best gelato, their only competition is frost - a close second. allegro is just too perfect."
Very Negative,3,0.268,1195,"you know everybody raves that this place is so good... but most of the people that i know that rave about it, come here for breakfast. maybe i'll have to give that a go someday. my experience here was for lunch. i had a spinach salad for lunch here, and it just was blasé. it came dry with no dressing. the waiter informed me that he forgot and had to go whip me up some in the kitchen. my partner does come here all the time (at breakfast though)for meetings with her friends and says it is fabulous. i just got my salad was nothing extraordinary or out of the park.  i had a spinach pear salad and it was not dressed, and had half a pair on it with a nut in the middle. that's it. all ingredients weren't totally chopped up and prepared in a cohesive manner and no dressing -- which i had a request because they forgot it - - had absolutely no herbaceous flavor. it came with a dry cut up chicken breast. it was fresh enough, just blasé. my partner had a southwest salad and hers was also dry and uneventful.  what i try it again? you bet! there is a quaint little patio in front of an inner plaza and the doors\windows open completely into the restaurant. next time breakfast? i believe so!"
Very Negative,4,0.268,164,wonderful atmosphere and service. pasta and veal were spot on.  only glitch was the carpaccio .. it was pre-sliced and frozen to the plate.  sent back with no issue
Very Negative,5,0.267,304,"quality sandwich! if you're looking for fresh ingredients in your sandwich the. this place is your place. you can request what you want in a sandwich much like subway but taste and freshness is far above subway. $5 for a half sandwich with a free side, i chose mini carrots. the half sandwich is filling."
Very Negative,4,0.267,165,incredible food. super expensive though worth it for like once every couple months maybe wish it was priced better but burger drink and fries like $16 is a bit steep
Very Negative,5,0.262,224,"the only place that was near riverpark inn in tucson to eat something. that 7.00 jalapeno burger, i got was the best decision i made for being stuck in tucson for august. and they had air conditioning. 5 stars completely."
Very Negative,5,0.262,559,"favorite spot to catch a movie. seats recline fully, spacious booths, comfortable and nice ambiance. great food menu with fair prices and gotta love the beer! just book early as seats are limited and fill up fast.  my only critique of this place would be the jalepeno popcorn. why put pickled jalepenos on popcorn? it makes the kernels super soggy and then you just get handfuls of peppers...lightly frying up the jalepenos with the kernels makes them crispy and delicious!!! that small gripe aside, this place rocks. ill rarely catch a movie anywhere else."
Very Negative,5,0.26,154,the oasis bar at the casino is awesome... the food is delucious.. the staff is great... our server was alexis and she did a great job... luv this place...
Very Negative,5,0.259,144,"love, love, love them! come - a - window - please .... thank you,  yes i will! only go with the the hot though and try the buffalo fries. mmmmm!"
Very Negative,5,0.251,252,i'm addicted..... cactus blossom iced tea smoked turkey and chicken...ribs you freakin name it this place is awesome  if you have been here and didnt find it addicting you need to try again things have settled at this location and holy cow its awesome
Very Negative,5,0.251,179,the best buffet sushi in town.  let me quantify that:  the only buffet sushi worth eating in town.  also a huge assortment of items for those who would rather gain weight instead.
Very Negative,5,0.249,294,"an unusal menu, friendly staff and extremely reasonable prices.  bosian food tends to be loaded with carbs, however, so it makes it more far difficult for diabetics and those watching their weight. that being said, whatever chef alisah makes, he pours his heart into it.  a truly talented chef."
Very Negative,4,0.245,513,"positives: + plethora of unique sandwich choices, you wont even know which one to have + always fully staffed (i swear i always see over 5 people working behind that small kitchen counter) so your sandwich is made so quick negatives: - plethora of unique sandwich choices, you wont even know which one to have, haha tried: + a whole bunch of different sandwiches i don't remember but all were good...only remember name of one called : anasazi chicken, would do again. cool: all sandwiches come with a cookie!"
Very Negative,5,0.24,566,"how does this place not have a 5 star rating and a million reviews????  i am telling you i have been around the world searching for a better tikka masala than this one. i wish i was kidding when i say this but i have to fly back to tucson every time i need this. get it spicy with an egg in it. and i usually go with all veggies.  every single one of my friends used to make fun of me in college because i would go get kababeque for pick up, and then walk about halfway home and then have to eat it on the sidewalk because i couldn't wait.  kababque, i love you."
Very Negative,5,0.239,333,"awesome food! loved the salsa bar. chicken enchiladas we're very tasty as well as the beef tacos. don't order the nachos, the cheese taste horrible it was worse than ballpark cheese and had a burnt taste. but that being said we would definitely come back here just skip the nachos next time! everything else was very fresh and tasty!"
Very Negative,4,0.238,89,probably the best late night in tucson. 1/2 price clams and mussels who doesn't love that
Very Negative,4,0.235,384,"havarti cheese on a sandwich? yes, please! i have never had anything from sausage deli other then the susie sorority, which is turkey and havarti cheese with veggies on wheat bread.  sandwiches here are always fresh, and sure, you can get a cheaper sandwich at subway but they don't have havarti cheese!  only thing i dislike about sausage deli is that they are not open on sundays."
Negative,5,0.263,546,my husband said the 1 bad thing about writing this review is that more people will come & e prices will rise :) but we can't resist...we tried wild garlic for the 1st time lasts nite for our anniversary/wow! it was terrific! we started with the swiss garlic fondue/could not have been better! we had the salmon and sea bass...amazing flavors just kept swirling around in our mouths :) the only down side was/as we read in other reviews there were flies and gnats :( so clearly that still needs to be addressed by management for continued success.
Negative,4,0.262,1322,"cheap drinks & shuffleboard! oh! you can buy a scratcher too. they have one of those arizona lottery machines in there.   the golden nugget is one of the few places around tucson that has a shuffleboard table. there is usually a line to play, but most of the people in there are pretty friendly. you could hang out around the bar, chat in one of their booths, or play pool while having an inexpensive drink.  one funny memory i had was when i had to go back in to grab my driver's license during the day. in order for the bartenders to give you pucks for the shuffleboard, you have to leave your driver's license as collateral. on my way out, i forgot to pick it up, so about a week later, i went in to pick it up. the nice lady behind the bar gave me a little smirk and pulled out about three, 4 inch thick stacks of  driver's license all rubber-banded together.  my eyes widened, and my heart sank. i thought: ""how long is this going to take? is it even in there?"" luckily for me, it seemed like the lady had done this before and maintained her smile the whole time she was shuffling through cards. at last! she found it and before handing it to me said "" you college students are all the same."" i politely thanked her and walked out thinking ""errrr... i graduated almost a year ago."" once a wildcat, always a wildcat!"
Negative,5,0.26,282,based off the pastry alone i have to give this 5 stars. the croissants (especially the almond one) were baked to perfection. the fillings were just right. i can't believe we haven't tried this sooner. the yelp reviewers who didn't like it must not have tried the addictive pastries.
Negative,5,0.259,209,"i absolutely love going to brooklynn's after running with the meet at maynard's club.  a large pizza for $8.99 (with the maynard's discount) and get it delivered to the sky bar next door, what could be better?"
Negative,5,0.256,242,"best brisket ever!! cole slaw and spicy collard greens were incredible.  this is mostly a take out place, but they have a few tables for sit down. the owner is super friendly and very hands on, insisting that we try samples of various things."
Negative,5,0.255,1081,"how is the restaurant not packed during happy hour?! after spending a week in tucson, i've decided that lodge on the desert is the best spot for happy hour in the city. i rarely eat at hotel restaurants because they're almost always overpriced with mediocre food, but after spending all day hiking in the sun, the boy and i could not be bothered to go out for dinner and decided that it was the perfect opportunity to try what is supposedly one of the top restaurants in tucson run by a tucson iron chef.  we went early during happy hour and many dishes were several dollars off. the standout was the slow braised pork taco. for $3, you get two tacos packed with tender, juicy, flavorful pulled pork. how good were they? let's just say we put in two more orders of it as we were eating the first order. they were definitely some of the best pork tacos we've had.  service was also top notch. the servers did not treat us differently because we were there for happy hour and paying less money than if we'd visited during regular hours. could not have had a better low key dinner."
Negative,4,0.255,294,"the best vietnamese food in tucson. the menu features vietnamese, chinese and thai food. get the vietnamese food because, uh, that's what kind of restaurant it is. don't be like those weirdos who order hamburgers at a mexican restaurant. be sure to try one of their boba tapioca slushie drinks."
Negative,5,0.254,1173,"dim sum!!! i have only been here for dim sum, and i eat it a lot.  on my most recent visit i was kind of worried about going.  it was saturday and around 10 o'clock, and from my experiences, if there is dim sum as good as gee's and it's a weekend, then there will be some broken hearts when the congee, chinese broccoli, roast pork, or the countless other treasures are disappearing faster than employees do when asked for a volunteer. we were seated promptly, then waited a while for our drink order to be taken, which is totally understandable since we were the first ones in the restaurant, no big deal.  then the carts started making their way through the veritable maze that is the dining hall. as always, fresh dim sum arrived; among the dishes mentioned above we also partook of, taro balls, lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice, peking duck, shrimp noodle, tripe, and egg custard (one of the best i have ever had, it may have been the phyllo type flaky crust).  the food was so good that i wouldn't allow there to be any leftovers, and stuffed myself to the brim with whatever was in front of me. too bad thanksgiving is this weekend, otherwise i'd be right back at gee's"
Negative,5,0.252,551,"this is, without a doubt, the finest place to get japanese food in tucson. while i would argue that they have some of the highest quality foodstuffs, that's honestly not even the best part about kazoku. the atmosphere and staff are always the example of perfect waiting. please understand that when i say always, i mean always. i have been here more than 300 times, easily, multiple times per week for many years.  the atmosphere doesn't get any better, the complimentary miso, soy beans, and ice cream are just icing on the cake. nothing bad to say."
Negative,5,0.251,415,"love the horchata chai half sweet on ice no whip cream.  usually they make it with 2% milk, but no not today.  how do i know?  i'm lactose intolerant and my body knows it immediately with the most satisfying long extremely smelly gas this planet can produce.  so word of caution if you are lactose intolerant be sure to ask for 2% or skim for your milk choice.  im not complaining, just warning.  thanks dutch bros."

Negative,5,0.248,734,"the best bbq in tucson. forget all the polls and whatever just drive there if you want the best. most people do not know one bbq from another, really. there are many styles like say kansas city or other such bbq want to be's. we are talking central texas here and when you walk in the door you may as well be in dallas or austin or even llano or abilene. if you want to see what real bbq is all about you have found the place. if i lived closer i would have bbq here at least once or more a week.....but sadly  i only can get here once a month.....so glad you can again get served vs just to go. it is at it's best at the table with lots of napkins and sauce as well as a cold beer.. thank you for being here as texas is a long drive."
Negative,4,0.246,416,"great pizza with very fresh ingredients.  the only reason that i am not a frequent customer is the price for both pizza and salads can get pretty steep.  that being said, there is a price for quality.  i understand the value of good ingredients but will personally sacrifice that to pay half the price as i have two kids that could care less.  overall very good..avoid the wings as they should be pulled off the menu"
Negative,4,0.241,217,"good is absolutely delicious and great service to go with it! this place is almost 5 starts however, the prices are high and have gotten higher over the last 6 months. this place can be expensive but the food is good."
Negative,5,0.239,705,"i ordered a gift card online on december 15th for delivery by xmas and it got to the person in marana 1st class mail after ny 2018, nice.  not only did the corporate office fail me in an epic fashion, and the person i sent it to, but they sent a blank card with no credit on it (nice)! wtf!  if it wasn't for amanda there at the marana sprouts, with all of her help in contacting the utter morons in the corporate office, the fine people i bought the card for wouldn't have their rightful $50 card plus an extra 15% off from amanda.  thanks to amanda and the book-keeper there that kept on the main office through her emails and follow-ups.  don't ever buy any gift cards from the website though, bad news"
Negative,5,0.237,226,"one of, if not the best pizza joints on the east end. the tree hugger pizza is the absolute best.  we got take out often, and the pizza barely made it home. hot, delicious and fresh ingredients make this an unforgettable meal."
Negative,5,0.228,838,"the concept is simple... you will never eat a better hot dog in your life.  bruce is open tues-thurs, and sat nights from around 8pm to 2am. he makes his hot dogs out of a normal looking cart outside of a brakemasters. bruce is truly a great and reliable guy, but more importantly makes unbelievable hotdogs with his secret recipe. his prices haven't changed in over 20 years: $2 for a regular dog, $3 for a bigger polish dog, $4 for a bratwurst (huge), and $1 for any softdrink/juice/water. that is his whole menu. i am a college student, and my friends and i have been going to bruce for about 3 years now, at least once a week, sometimes 3. not one of us have ever gotten sick from his food. we sometimes joke about flying back to tucson once in a while after we graduate just to get our fix haha if you havn't tried it, you gotta!!"
Negative,4,0.227,208,what a tucson treasure...where else can you go and try out new and interesting wines for $10.00? the staff is wonderful.... but i really like the door greeter cuvee. i must remember to bring treats next time.
Negative,5,0.225,236,"wonderful yogurt, and wonderful service. what i really love about this place however is their frozen yogurt pies. they are to die for! during these covid-19 times, the flavors are limited but there is always something wonderful on hand."
Neutral,5,0.287,843,"this review is for the market portion of maynards market & kitchen. walk through the front door and you're greeted with an artful display of tempting pastries, to your left is delicious coffee, and next to the counter, gorgeous breakfast or lunch. gorgeous entries? yeah -- like those photos in magazines that make you hungry. a warming-light over food may cause you to doubt, but i'm here to encourage you past that -- grab the egg croissant, try the pot pie, snag that empanada -- the food is wonderful, the pastries are decadent. if frozen treats are more your style, maynard's has an assortment of single-serve homemade ice cream and cheesecake.  i should mention that the market really is a market, with organic produce, groceries, and gifts items. they also sell beer and wine. but oh-my-goodness, our breakfast croissants were awesome!"
Neutral,5,0.287,164,"coffee and candy, oh boy. a great coffee shop, candy store, ice-cream, and gift shop all in one. i believe they even serve hot and cold food, but not a 100 percent."
Neutral,1,0.286,426,"this is the third time i've been to this location for carry out and this is the third time i've had to wait at least 15 minutes more than the time i selected for carry out. i go to these carry out places because my wife is at work and i like to surprise her with lunch. when the order is 15 minutes late, my wife's lunch break is already over by the time i get it to her. if i could leave 0 stars; i would. will not come back."

Neutral,1,0.282,361,"i ran into this target shopping and hoping to grab a starbucks coffee while there.  there was myself and one other customer, a friend of the managers', and she was evidently more interested in telling him about her private life, pg, marriage being a manager etc. then even notifying me she would be with me in a minute.  saved myself $5 on that one.  pass it by"
Neutral,1,0.282,223,"3rd time is the charm. flavorless, filled with msg and soggy. egg rolls have no crunch including the orange chicken. the red sauce throws me off as well. the egg foo young is decent but this place still gets 1 star from me."

Neutral,1,0.278,304,"maybe they should rename it ""put everything on the plate you can find!"" i ordered the veal and the plate had 8 different vegetables under the veal! the plate was swimming in sauce and the veal tasted like it was cooked an hour before serving. i hope he has better luck with his next dining establishment."
Neutral,5,0.277,659,"wow, if you're lucky enough to score a table in this tiny restaurant you're in for a treat. it's a restaurant that uses purely locally sourced ingredients, with an open kitchen and a minimalist approach. the result is that they create the few things that are on their menu with perfection. the small size and minimal staff might be what allows them to offer a superior experience at a reasonable price. my wife and i split a salad, a pizza and a dessert. we each had a (local) beer and we ended up spending only $50 feeling like we just ate a 5-star establishment. good luck finding the place as there is no signage on the building. look for the red light! ;)"

Neutral,5,0.271,1624,"birrieria guadalajara i love you. for twenty five years, i have loved you. it's crazy to think that you have been one of my most constant and passionate affairs. at first i was afraid to go near you. you look rough and are in a rough neighborhood. 22nd street and fourth ave. transients, hookers, junkies, train tracks. the park across the street where the filth makes deals while decent families watch their kids play little league baseball. man, it was crazy back in the day. but i found my courage and bravely opened the cage door. a steel enclosed patio. inside, 4 tables, 5 or 6 counter seats. a tiny tiny kitchen. huge stock pots of steaming soup. a plancha and fryer. staffed by beautiful little nanas that don't speak english and only take cash. the best dish is probably everything. tacos and burros. birria, lengua, cabeza, chili colorado, flautas de papa, filete de pescado, tortas. i probably know the menu by heart. daily specials. soups to die for- menudo, posole, cocido. but really, i fell in love with your simple bean tostadas. crispy corn tortilla, the best refried beans ever, lettuce, cotija, radish, a little warm tomato sauce, a wedge of lime...and the best most lip burning salsa in the universe. the salsa is key. it's not tomato with jalapeño and onion and cilantro. it's chile tepin and vinegar and salt. holy maria it is the real deal. it's that burning kiss that stays on your lips and man, i love that. oh, and it must be consumed right away or else it gets soggy and falls apart. but i love eating it barehanded. it's primal. sensual. bean tostada amor. mmmm. i love you birrieria guadalajara."

Positive,1,0.276,1485,"beware of the prices on the drink menu! what you read isn't what you pay! i ordered a glass of wine priced at $8/glass. when i received my check, i was charged $9. when i pointed out the error, the waitress checked with the manager and returned to tell me the real price was $9. i was pointed to the fine print at the bottom of the menu that claims they have the right to change the price at any time without notice, and i was required to pay the $9! wth? who does that? good thing it was only $1. imagine if they decided that glass of wine was worth $15! wrong in so many ways. as far as the food, i ordered a honey mustard dressing for my salad. the dressing arrived in a small cup, and it looked suspiciously like plain yellow mustard. i tasted it, and it tasted like plain yellow mustard. i sent it back and ordered a raspberry vinaigrette. the new dressing arrived with the comment that their honey mustard dressing is made by mixing yellow mustard with honey. seriously? the vinaigrette was some olive oil mixed with a bit of raspberry puree. fairly tasteless. apparently, the chef doesn't realize that a vinaigrette is supposed to have vinegar in it!  chicken pot pie was like a mass of stewed chicken. no chunks of chicken to be found. it was tasty enough, but looked like it had been on the stove for several days.my dining companion had the reuben sandwich. he commented the corned beef was tough and chewy. needless to say, i won't be back nor will i recommend it to anyone."
Positive,2,0.275,1045,"let's start of with the positive side...cute gift shop, attentive staff and while we didn't try any of their desserts, they looked wonderful!! now the not so good side. took my mom here over the weekend because all we've ever heard is how good it is. went for breakfast, she had huevos rancheros and i had the beef chorizo (they don't have pork) scramble with cheddar cheese and salsa on top. we both had the potatoes with our dishes too. all of it was bland, bland, bland. the chorizo had hardly any flavor, the salsa tasted like the cheapest jarred stuff you will ever find, the potatoes weren't even seasoned. my mom felt the same way about her dish, it just looked like the most generic of ingredients. i had to dump tapatio and tabasco on mine and my mom went the salt route, she hardly ever uses salt, so i knew it was bad...ha haaaa! i can say the portions were huge and even if it had been good we wouldn't have been able to finish it all. that's a plus, you get a lot for the money, but sadly we won't be back because it was just ""meh""!"
Positive,2,0.274,209,tried to do a 50th anniversary lunch for 27 people. been told 3 times in last 3 weeks chef would call me back. no call. been going here for 33 years and always loved it. just tell me no! so sad. won't be back.
Positive,1,0.273,1322,i'm really saddened to say that i went to this business that has a good reputation and food was said to be great to find out that i will never eat here! my husband has been before said it was great went with his co workers. we do deliveries for grub hub on the side for extra money and came to get the order. the hostess which she has dark long black hair never got her name because she was down right rude from the get go! we asked about the order which had two steaks and they didn't say wether it was kids or not so my husband replied that the total of $34 was a really low price for all the lady ordered making sure we were paying for the two big steaks to which she replied the tbone is kids sized so he said oh ok just making sure. she never looks up and then he said well that's not all the order the customer has stroganoff too she said well the order is correct we don't carry stroganoff anymore and precedes to ask for payment and says is that all in a really bad attitude in which left me with a bad taste in my mouth! if she represents the company they should consider how this affects their business as this istucson plenty of steak places to eat at. with this pandemic going on there is not as much people eating out. treat everyone that comes in with a happiness that they are there eating in your business.
Positive,1,0.267,296,this place prices has gone up tremendously!  i walked in to order and looked at prices and everything is way over priced.  so i walked right out and got it cheaper else where. so unless you want to spend a lot then go ahead. but it isn't budget friendly at all..  15$ for a burro n drink??? nope.
Positive,1,0.267,824,i went to one of you're locations here in tucson last weekend on 12/04/17 at approximately at 10 pm and i presented and coupon to the lady for when you buy 20$ worth of coins you get 20$ free. i was charged 40$ and the lady immediately realized she charged me the wrong amount and apologized and said it'll go back on my card in 2 business days. and proceeded to do the correct purchase of 20$.  she never gave my receipt i went to reach for it and she took it. i did screen shot the purchase on my bank statement for proof. i never received my 40$ it's been over a week and i want my money. i'm very very very upset with this service. you're company basically stole from me and has not returned it to me. i will be contacting you're corporate and i hope you're location is happy that you stole money from a paying customer.
Positive,1,0.263,777,"went opa for lunch today, i was alone and was seated relatively soon. i ordered the gyro platter. i noticed that all the other tables were brought a complementary appetizer, i was not. my food arrived in a reasonable time. it was prepared as the menu described. i was not asked if my food okay at any point. the staff passed by me many times to offer refills on drinks....i was never offered a refill. i completed  my meal and stacked my dishes to the edge of the table. staff passed my table nearly twenty times and never picked up my dishes. yet other tables were cleared when the guest had completed  their meal. it took 15 minutes for my check to be brought to me. i was treated as a second class customer. if this is how they treat single customers, i will not be back!!!!"
Positive,1,0.259,699,"this review is based on management and quality of service. we normally order in mama's on friday night. we have had an issue with wrong sauces or not enough in the past. the last order we received no sauces with 2 combo meals. i called the store and tony the ""night kitchen manager"" told me that he delivered my order and it was close to closing so there was nothing he could do about it. which blows my mind that the manager 1 didnt check the order and 2 couldnt have cared less. he informed me tammy the morning manager would call me the next day and rectify my situation. as its been a week and no one seems to care i'm posting this review so others are aware of your management customer service."
Positive,1,0.258,661,"this place is a minus 10.  we stayed friday night and their prices for what you get is above and beyond. we went to their friday night buffet. tbone steak cooked for you individually!? right?  i had one bite and left the rest on my plate. do thin my shoe soles are thicker. i wouldn't have given it to my dog. casino games so tight you might as well just drive up, give them you money and leave. if you are a spanish speaking person ""as your first language""  stay here. of all their tv channels only one or two were english speaking. recommend if you want a great casino, with good food and great gaming, try matazal in payson az. now their is a place to visit."
Positive,1,0.235,442,"sad sandwiches - which for me every visit are mostly all thick-slice bread - a bare minimal sliver of lettuce, a sheer-bare slice of tomato. good bread. good gazpacho. last visit for gazpacho, the very young girl didn't care about what i was asking & ordering - - seemingly disinterested. she had to 'void' the order twice until my fellow dining companion helped me clarify what i was pointing at on their menu. pay attention to the customer!"

Very Positive,1,0.293,885,"disappointed in management? ownership? i went to lunch today and service was great, we had a server in training, sweet girl with red hair. food was perfect, i love the california wrap. this was all made less than perfect by an older gentleman with a black shirt and graying hair. a young homeless man came in and asked for water and i watched this man turn him away. in arizona. when it was over a hundred degrees out. i'm still trying to understand what i saw. i worked in a restaurant for years and realize sometimes you get ""frequent flyers"" that never order anything and just want water. and because i have a soul, i never questioned it, i got them water and they always left quickly. the homeless gentleman left without making a scene, which was pretty nice. everyone knows there's a law here where you can't turn someone down for water. i hope pita jungle can explain this to me?"
Very Positive,2,0.29,2797,"oh my!! i have been waiting, and waiting  for a couple of years now actually to review this place, cause i believe a lot of people will think i am crazy after they read my review. (if anything has changed and the place is better i guess i will never know cause after my experience i never felt like going back in there again) most of my friends love this place, and talk about how good the food is etc. my friend, who is a foodie like me had heard so many good things about it and decided it was time to try it out and she invited me. we got into the place and of course our eyes opened up, the decoration in this place is very sexy. (that and the drink i had is why i am giving it 2 stars) got to sit by the window, which was nice. the waiter came with a board in his arms (menu) and started almost singing the menu by memory.  i was as impressed as i was confused. after that was done he waited for us to chose something, which to me felt like pressure, then he mentioned they had a ""chef's pick"" option, which is basically the chef pics 2 or 3 items on the menu.  i went with that last option because, as i said before, i was to confuse to think. we got a little more time to choose a drink than we did food, for which at that point i was thankful. i picked a flavored martini they had on the menu. it was good i won't lie and say i did not like it, cause i did, plus it was served on a decent size glass.  the food came to the table... i have to stop and sigh now.  i had to take a pause and explore my plate to make sure that what i was served was not the left overs from the day. i am not trying to be rude cause i know putting the plate together must of taken some type of effort, but in my opinion it was a fail. i wish i had a picture but i will try to describe it. on my plate there was a pineapple top, not just a leaf here and there as decoration but the whole thing. also on my plate there was what looked like a half eaten apple. just the top with stem, seeds and all placed on the plate. i moved on and tasted the food. growing up in a hispanic family i know how a corn tamale, and beef stew are suppose to taste. the corn tamale was more of a sweet tamale. it had way to much sugar and was covered on a pumpkin cream, which was to sweet itself. the stew was hard, dry and flavorless. i was not able to eat it. most of both of our plates were left almost intact. i must say our disappointment was as big as the check. 60 dollars for each of us was a fortune for what we were served. which i could say the service, or something other than the decoration and drink (which was not even a well made craft drink, and maybe it was not even that good but compared to the other stuff, i am going to say it was) in my opinion the name of this place goes in hand with how i would describe it."
Very Positive,2,0.29,809,"so i love chipotle, every time i go in to one i have a great experience, delicious food and fast service. well not here. so i get my normal order, a barbacoa bowl with a regular drink. it looks amazing, and as i sit down in notice something in my lettuce. it's a dead bug. so i bring it to the front and i let them know, and they were very apologetic and they remade my bowl. i got to sit down and eat it, and it's half of what the other girl gave me, and it's pretty much just juice from the beans and he forgot my rice. so i take it back up for a third time. still very apologetic and they remade my bowl again, but this time i watch him, and he almost forgets my rice again, so i told him and he was very rude about it. this is probably my least favorite chipotle and i probably won't be eating here again."
Very Positive,2,0.287,450,"this place was a rite of passage for incoming classes. greasy, cheap, filling, and delicious food after a night of house party hunting for those pre-21 nights. the home of the world famous highland burrito... at least through my bittersweet and nostalgic rose tinted glasses. seems like full time management has moved in and removed the magic. its no longer student operated....by students, for students... give me back my glory days. not this mess.."

Very Positive,2,0.273,2821,"i have this mate of mine with a truly voracious sexual appetite.   spicy, sweet, well-aged, full-bodied, whatever...  in simple guy-speak, even a lackluster tête-à-tête is still something better to do than sit at home perfecting skills on guitar hero.  while i have to agree when it comes to matters of the mattress, it doesn't quite jive with matters of the palette. we came into tucson for a few days of frolic and fun and decided to check out elle as recommended from a friend.  first off, the wine selection was excellent, chosen from varietals across the globe by someone who obviously has a true passion for the vin and a complex taste to match.  if i were just reviewing the wine, i would give elle five stars, particularly coupled with the personal attention we received from the manager, who took several minutes out of his time for a wonderful discussion about the textures and characteristics of the selections.  the staff is friendly, down to earth and the unpretentious ambiance seems to reflect this personality.  you can even buy bottles for takeaway at a 30% discount, which my pocketbook appreciates. but then we ordered food (big mistake) and the cuisine is what brings this review down to two stars for me.  french is hard to do, particularly in arizona, but french paired with new american reminds me of that dumpy date that might've looked appealing in the pub the night before, but you just can't get rid of the morning after.   expected hints of roasted red peppers were beaten from the bruschetta by a heavy-handed drowning of bitter olive soup glopped on top of our appetizer.  the escargot served on filo made its own little crimean war on the plate and the results were not pretty.  if only there was enough garlic to keep the peace!  but the pan-seared ahi tuna was where i abandoned all hope.  i'm just a simple girl from alaska, but even i know the difference between pan-seared and bar-b-qued, my friends.  at first i thought perhaps it was a mistake, but after sending it back for a second try (which i hate doing), i got the same dismal, dry, tasteless overcooked results.  it finally dawned on me that the chef was actually doing it on purpose!  what the... molesting tuna like that is a crime.  not sure if the chef last night was also the owner listed on the restaurant website, but man, i hope not. overall this place has wonderful potential, but until they fire the chef de cuisine (or better yet, have him arrested), simplify their approach to the menu and concentrate on what they are good at (the wine... oh the wine!!), then i definitely would drink but not dine.this is the kind of local jewel with a good heart that you really want to see succeed.  but until they make some needed changes, i'll have to chalk it up to an amusing one-night stand and get back to guitar hero."
Very Positive,1,0.271,716,i have been here before.  the rude owner so i thought was not enough to keep me from trying it again last month.  my friend and i went there apparently when she was off.  our two wine tasting waitresses were amazing. one full of great advice and the other full of charm and personality.  we decided to return again after loving this experience only to find the owner yvonne belittling one of the waitresses who was working alone.  the place was also having a party for owner plus had the regular customers to care for.  i will never go back....and my 3 friends felt the same.  such a damn shame. if you don't treat all of your customers well nor your staff then get out of business because word travels fast my dear.
