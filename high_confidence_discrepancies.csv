Very Negative,3,0.915,"the only reason i'm rating 3 stars is solely because i love the wings here. everything else is bad! bad food, bad service unless you are in the bar area. our waitress was so awkward!! she would walk past our table, stare and not say a thing. i told her i didn't like my lettuce wraps and she took them away, then brought me my check with them on there, she wanted to charge me for them. what the hell? i made her take them off. my salad was literally hot because they put the hot chicken over it and it made it soggy. literally one of my worst experiences at a restaurant.",572

Very Negative,3,0.907,"i had a grubhub order from here. a large plate for 3 people. the chow mein was great as was the 2 orders of orange chicken. the 3rd was broccoli beef. it was so bad. the broccoli tasted rancid and there was only 1 piece of beef smaller than my pinky finger. i will never order that from here, ever again. nor do i recommend anyone else order the broccoli beef. worst. thing. ever!!!",382

Very Negative,5,0.906,"devastation! that's the only word that currently comes to mind when i think of el torero. every weekend i head to el torero with my family for our favorite mexican food fix. just the other day we excitedly walked up to the front door to stumble across a horrific sign.....closed/for sale.  what?!?!? this can't be happening. our favorite mexican food restaurant in all of tucson is closing and for sale!?!? this is a complete catastrophe. what are we going to do now? i am really going to miss you, el torero, and i'm especially going to miss my favorite waitress shorty and the best (i mean best) cheese enchiladas and ground beef tacos in the world.  this family run business has been serving authentic mexican food for years and was one of a kind! i've been going to el torero with my family since i was a little kid. it was our weekend tradition and one that will never be forgotten. thanks for all the great memories, food, and fun el torero.",949

Very Negative,3,0.899,i think this place has a lot of potential but the customer service was the worst i have ever seen. i have never left a bad review and i'm too kind to even put one star which is what i would truly rate this place. i had a few people ask me about this place and i simply told them your experience might be better but they don't want to go now. no so epic is how i would describe it. nevertheless i hope they work it out and i wish them all the best. my suggestion hire grant cardone.,481

Very Negative,5,0.894,"this establishment is the absolute worst place i have ever been. a few friends and i went there on saturday nov. 29th to karaoke and have some dinner. the food was just nasty and not worth the money. as far as the karaoke went, we were enjoying ourselves when this drunk obnoxious idiot named derrick got up and very loudly screamed out a song and it was very offensive. it included the f--k word numerous times. he was about 21. not cool. then we found out thst this punk was the manager!!! he showed no respect for anyone else there. then he got more drunk. when we complained to the owner he said ""he's just having fun"". like he condones this kind of thing!! ridiculous!! then the owner accused us of not buying anything and told us to take our business elsewhere! we all bought dinner!!! this place is definately not worth your time and the food sucks! i would not recommend this place to anyone unless you like drunk punks who think they are all that. don't bother. they could care less!! when i tried to post this it wouldn't let me unless i chose a star rating. i tried to give one star so i could post this. it highlighted all the stars!!! i didn't want to give them any stars. they suck!!!!!",1200

Very Negative,3,0.89,"got a gift certificate for this ham place. the ham was actually extremely tasty, although very expensive, which didn't matter, since it was covered by the gift certificate. but since i had some left over balance on the gift card i purchased 6 side dishes, the potatoes au gratin, the broccholi casserole, the beans and the apple cinnamon desert. i must say that all the side dishes were absolutely horrible. i will go back to the store to get another ham, should i ever get another gift certificate, but i will never ever get these sides dishes again, not even if they were free of charge.",589

Very Negative,3,0.883,"oh dear!  we've now got to la prices without the food, service or sophistication to warrant such prices.  what started out as a very good bistro type restaurant, with appropiate pricing, has suddenly taken on amusing airs and graces.  food now seems less important than patrons' posing; service seems less important than being cool; keeping reservations seems less important than overbooking. as an award, this restaurant has the worst service, bar none.  this writer's companion wrote to the owners just after opening pointing out the problems with the service.  she received no response.  i guess they don't care or understand because on each subsequent visit things only got worse.",685

Negative,4,0.95,"i've been here for happy hour and bar food a few times and though i like the atmosphere and the drinks, the food is just not that good. usually janos's restaurants are worth the splurge, but the times i've ordered food here i just haven't been impressed, so for a discount at happy hour it's a great option but otherwise i'm just not excited to spend a good dinner's night out here. the atmosphere is fun at the tables and for two or three at the bar, but it can be tricky and a little crowded at the bar if you're with a bigger group.",537
Negative,4,0.949,i love how they offer vegan pizza!  but their sauce can sometimes be too acidic for my taste.  i usually feel kind of sick after eating it (too salty?).,152
Negative,4,0.948,"i've eaten here many times, and i'm a big fan of the food. however, the service is not great and the atmosphere in the restaurant is not great either. la indita is housed in an old building on 4th ave that probably hasn't been renovated in decades, and it sometimes feels a little stuffy inside. so, if atmosphere is a big deal to you, i wouldn't recommend la indita. if food is all that matters to you, i would definitely recommend la indita. they have excellent chips and salsa, the chicken mole is very good, and the tarascan tacos are super-tasty. =)",555
Negative,4,0.948,"good personal pizza, but the crust is a little too burn in some spots. i like my crust extra crispy, but sometimes it's a little too charred at fired pie. the toppings and cheese taste awesome tho. this is like a lot of those build your own pizza places, but these pizzas have a little more uniqueness to them.",310
Negative,4,0.946,"our family loved mod but i wish they would cook the pizzas a little bit longer. anytime there is more then about 3 toppings on the pizza, they tend to be under cooked.  we have stuck to just ordering a few toppings and therefore our pizzas have been great but anytime we add more we are disappointed.",300
Negative,4,0.946,"i used to love this bar for all the reasons other people have written about, but in the last few months the staff has changed, and many (not all) of the bartenders are not quite as friendly, knowledgeable, and interactive as they used to be. i'm looking for another hangout just in case.",287

Negative,4,0.944,"i've eaten here twice once dining in and once for takeout the food is always amazing,  i've had the lavish chicken wrap and the salmon plate 4 very good and i would order again. but it feels like there consistently short staffed the food takes a long time to come out and the server seem overworked. whoever is running this place might want to think about adding some more staff.(they may just be running less staff due to covid, but it seems there is enough business to have some one working to go orders, and someone to focus on tables)",538

Neutral,1,0.937,"the company boasts a brewery and a separate bistro location within the city limits.   we drove the ten minutes to the bistro and found ourselves in the middle of a monkey-muraled mishap. not the logo, just the impression it made.  it was everywhere; painted on the building's side in the style of an antiquated graphic stamp, on the floor, on the ceiling and the walls, on our table, in the decor, on the bar, the beers, the bathrooms...cute.  the iconic monkey's impressive coup de main may be the only reason for the continued survival of the business.  the beer isn't bad either, especially the...monkey shine?  monkey--anyone need further elaboration..? we ordered two appetizers to begin:  ""nachos nimbus"" and ""monkey burn.""  (menu: http://www.nimbusbeer.com/bistro/bistro%20menu.pdf) the menu brags a delicious description of the ""house-made cheese blend"" that sits atop the ""house-made tortilla chips"" of the nimbus nachos.  my question, should a member of the nimbus staff wander across this critique, is: at who's frigg'n house was this food made? i found a comparable ""cheese blend"" in that handy machine at the corner store.  you know the one; you pulled the lever a couple dozen times at 3am--underage but smashed out of your mind and sick with the munchies.  it is a sauce, a cheese sauce, and whether you open the large bags that hold it all together in the back of a restaurant or the back of a volkswagen, it doesn't belong in a bistro. can i get a ""circle k,"" anybody..?  also, there is avocado, there is salsa, but there was not a drop of the ""avocado salsa"" mentioned on the menu anywhere on the dish.  there was corn in my salsa, no avocado, and while there may have been chicken on the nachos as ordered--gustavo and i  debated whether the thin slivers of white spread with thrifty sense throughout were meat or, as i posited, ""just our imaginations""-- it certainly wasn't enough chicken to merit it as a choice we needed to make while ordering. now, both my man and i have an appreciation for spicy foods.  the eating of them is traditional in his culture and has always been a favorite indulgence of mine.  but ""monkey burn""... have you ever had the capsicum annum variety black pearl straight from a botanist's garden?  i have, a good friend of mine grows a few of the hearty plants.  the small pepper, which does indeed resemble a tiny black pearl at its start, packs a wallop that will leave your eyes watering and your mouth begging for a piece of bread. it rates much higher in scoville heat units (shu), coming in at 30,000, than the jalapeño at 2,000-5,000 (google a diagram.) after eating ""monkey burn"" i'm convinced the chefs at nimbus have learned how to use a chili shaped cake pan to mold, bread and fry police-grade pepper spray. suffice it to say, we took those to go.  after i d'breaded them at home, they were so raw that i stored and used them sparingly in some homemade salsa. the coup de grâce:  it could have been a saving grace, but the bacon mac & cheese ",4053

Positive,2,0.939,"service was friendly and quite good, which is the minimum you would expect from an over priced steak house. once in a while the waitress would come by with the table cumber (the metal crumb scraper thingy) to clean the table a bit. that's always a nice touch. the menu was decent in terms of selection. i eat out a lot (way more than i'd like or more than i probably should) and i'm no cheapskate. still, even for me $40+ for just a mediocre steak is a little hard to swallow (figuratively and literally).  and that's just for a plate with a cooked meat of some kind on it. sides? those are extra. if the mean was phenomenal, then i wouldn't bat an eye... we all decide to go with the combo meals (aka pre fixe menu) rather than order everything a-la-carte.  we sent back the bisque because it was way to salty. the steaks came out ok, but they were not really rubbed or seasoned from what i could tell. at the risk of sounding immodest, i prepare a much better steak on the grill at home. a nice rub, some simple salt and pepper, after cooking let sit a few minutes with little bit of butter melted on top. anyway, i ordered the salmon. it was cooked perfectly and tasted very good. i tasked the steak and it was just, meh. also, the inside could use a really good cleaning. the floor coming/going from the kitchen area into the main dining hall is well worn and grimy looking. it's not super well lighted (like most fancy steak houses) so i did not really check out the rest of the place for wear and tear.  i don't know - maybe it's must me - but if i'm dropping a couple hundred dollars on dinner, i expect a little more attention to detail and better food.",1663

Positive,2,0.933,"service was good. place had a nice environment, it is clean, and the restrooms were also neat and clean.  it was around 2 pm when i visited this place and they were serving brunch. i wasn't too impressed with their brunch menu, i had the pulled pork nachos. the pulled pork meat was more like diced pieces than a shredded meat that i was expecting, it was an alright taste. the cob chicken salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty, the meat loaf was alright. they do have good mimosas!  i may come back for the lunch or dinner menu, and check it out.",552
Positive,2,0.933,"i grew up on brooklyn italian food and the food here was a decent attempt.  liked the way the first half of the restaurant was decorated with the gingham red tablecloth, made it feel authentic.  back area blah. was there for lunch and had the chicken piccata lunch special.  my bad, should have told them not to use no butter, just olive oil.  just ok.  salad bar uninspiring, but minestrone soup was good, so was the service.",427

Positive,2,0.932,nice corner family restaurant. the ambiance isn't bad. southwest feel with plenty of televisions so you won't miss the game because your out with the family.  the food is ok. general american fair. most dishes do have a pre prepped by us foods feel.  the staff is friendly and for the most part attentive. the prices could come down as the food is not seller.  we've come several times as my daughters like the kids menu and the drawing paper and crayons.,458

Very Positive,1,0.851,"this review is for the lakeside spa and fitness center only! the resort is the best i've ever stayed at, with the best customer service i've ever had! the young woman at the front desk check in at the resort was incredible and changed my room to one right off the lobby with the  best views. alex with poolside service was amazing. timothy at the concierge was incredible and helpful  and so was in room dining. this review needs to focus on the spa. it was the worst spa experience i have ever had hands-down. from the moment i walked in the older lady behind the counter looked annoyed to even be there. she got my name incorrect twice, didn't ask me to fill out the pertinent paperwork, then asked me if i knew where i was going and when i said no she said oh fine i'll have to show you then. at which point she handed me a robe to put on that smelled so foul i could tell it had not been washed. so she took me to the locker room and upon entering ignored me and started helping another guest whom couldn't figure out their locker. then she just walked out with me standing there. another client was standing there and had to talk me through how to do the locker. so when i was finished with that i changed my disgusting dirty robe out for a clean one that was in the locker. now for the massage. it was the most unprofessional inappropriate experience i have had to date. my massage therapist told me in detail about many things in her past that i would not be comfortable telling my own family. it was so awkward i didn't know how to get out of the conversation and she just kept going into detail about very private things. i cannot imagine why she would ever think it was ok to tell a complete stranger these things, nonetheless someone that she is giving a service to. after the 55 minutes of pure awkwardness, i went into the locker room to shower. when i stepped into the shower there were clumps of hair in the drain that were quite noticeable. it is so amazing that this bad of service is connected with the resort, because the resort is an absolute shining beacon. it makes me wonder if the spa is independently ran and owned? because they cannot have the same person over seeing it. if they do, something must be done at the spa, and if they don't, the person that runs and manages  has to be fired and replaced. i am still shuddering. i can't bring myself to name my massage therapist. as a person she seemed sweet but desperate to have someone listen to her unfortunate past. the types of details she told me belong in a mental health therapists office, not. a massage therapy setting and never being told to the client whom is a captive audience. please use this as a teachable moment with the spa staff. i am still uncomfortable thinking about it. .",2768
Very Positive,1,0.85,"do not let this restaurant cater your party!!! i recently had a cinco de mayo birthday party that was for 30+ people.  i had ordered approximately $250 in food 5 days before the event.  i called on the morning of the event and was assured that everything would be perfect.  when almost an hour had passed and the food had still not arrived, i called the restaurant manager.  i was given every excuse under the sun including that they had never received my order.  however suddenly they miraculously found my order and told me it would be 45 more minutes.  i sent two of my guests to get the order instead and the food was ""only"" 1 1/2 hrs late.  this was a very important party for me and thankfully everyone was having such a great time that it wasn't disastrous, but it very well could have been!  i spent a lot of money on the party and the manager didn't take a penny off the bill even though he totally screwed up the order!  i personally feel that because it was close to mother's day, they got slammed at the restaurant and he just totally blew my order off!  i will never ever go to this restaurant again and certainly will never rely on them to cater a party for me!",1176

Very Positive,3,0.838,"i feel a little weird/sad as i post these mere three stars because honestly, these noodle soups are the best i've ever had! they have the most incredible flavor that i have not found with any of their competitors. they are thoughtful with their marinated vegetable toppings which include mushrooms, green beans, scallions, and peanuts. their portion sizes are wonderful, and no matter which one you order, you're always going to have fantastic, comforting spoonfuls of deliciousness. the three stars however, is due to the lack of vegan options. my personal opinion is that in this day and age you must have good vegan/vegetarian options. they advertise vegan and vegetarian options but they are truly meeger. you must offer tofu and vegetable broth at a ramen place if you are trying to appeal to vegans and vegetarians, period. i ordered the shrimp, but honestly, i didn't want to. i normally order fried tofu for my protein which they do not offer. if they had an organic tofu option for protein, a vegetable broth option, and if they were flexible on substituting one broth for another(my husband always prefers beef broth, which they have, but they would not substitute the chicken broth for the beef broth for his soup order), then i would definitely give them five stars in the future! as of now, i don't know if i'll be back. management-please take note!:-)",1366

Very Positive,1,0.827,"i'm not from tucson, and to be honest i had pretty low expectations for a boba joint in a city that appears to have low diversity (referring to asians). but this place is amazing. the tea itself is legit. along with the milk. i got a regular chatime milk tea (30% sweetness) and it was the best original milk tea i have had. i'm incredibly surprised it beats all of the milk tea spots i've tried in los angeles. the milk tea at chatime really has the tea flavor that you can tell is high quality. the people behind the counter said they use loose leaf tea to make it which is demonstrated through the delicious flavor.  i highly recommend this place for their milk tea as i can't comment on anything else, but i'll definitely be coming here often when i visit tucson. open earlier please edit (9/16/16): this is super important. they make their own toppings in house. the ginger tea comes from ginger they grate in the back. the banana milk tea comes from real bananas condensed in the back. same with the strawberries, rose, etc. i thought this was ubiquitous to all chatimes but it isn't. i found a chatime in la and was super excited cause i thought they had the same menu as this tucson one. bigmistake. the chatime in la had none. it was all artificial and fake flavorings. since when does tucson beat los angeles in a boba contest?!?!! the tucson chatime that this review is for seriously is amazing. i am in disbelief and disappointed that i only get to go to this chatime four days a year (but twice a day when i'm there). edit (december 2017): sigh. all good things must come to an end. as you've probably read, management has changed. i've gone there several times in 2017 (april, august, october and december) and the drinks have been pitiful each time. they no longer make ingredients fresh, the boba has been stale, and the workers are so unhappy. the staff in 2016 was absolutely amazing and proud of the drinks they made. the current staff must be quickly employees sabotaging chatime because they really don't want to be there. i got my usual ginger milk tea each time i visited and it just isn't the same. today there wasn't even ginger. i'd avoid this place. i think bing's will be my new go to. goodbye once loved chatime. rip.",2250
